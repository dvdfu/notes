#Facade Pattern

*Problem*: the client needs to interact with a subsystem of multiple complex classes.

*Example*: a card game involves a number of necessary backend classes such as `Player`, `Card`, `Deck`, etc. The GUI client needs a simple way to interface with the entire game, so a `Game` class can be created that unifies and simplifies interaction.

*Solution*: create a single interface that restricts client interaction with the subsystem classes.

#Iterator Pattern

*Problem*: we want to iterate through elements of a collection, that may be stored in any way.

*Example*: we want to apply a function `transform()` to all elements of a collection.

*Solution*: create an **iterator** class that defines *how* to traverse a collection, and does so without exposing the collection's implementation.

#Decorator Pattern

*Problem*: an object contain many arbitrary components and functionalities in any kind of combination. Distinguishing between multiple objects using inheritance can lead to many different subclasses and unmanageable code.

*Example*: a window can contain many components, such as scrollbars, menu bars, frames, and borders. There is no practical way to represent all combinations using inheritance.

*Solution*: we use a **decorator**, which wraps other nested components. A decorator intercepts calls to its children, such as `draw()`. It can add functionality, cancel calls, add new operations, and so on.

###Properties

Decorators encapsulate features and additional responsibilities that are added or removed at runtime.

Decorators can only be used when all components operate independently.

###Implementation

Decorated objects are created by passing their components when constructing them.

```c++
// FileListing, Border, HScroll, and VScroll all extend VisualComponent
// bsList is the wrapper, and is responsible for drawing its components
VisualComponent* list = new FileListing();
VisualComponent* bList = new Border(list);
VisualComponent* bsList = new HScroll(new VScroll(bList));
...
bsList->draw();
```
