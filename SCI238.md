##Reason for Seasons

Earth's axis points in the same direction (to **Polaris**) all year round, so its orientation relative to the Sun changes as Earth orbits the Sun.

Summer occurs in your hemisphere when sunlight hits it more directly; winter occurs when the sunlight is less direct.

**Axis tilt** is the key to the seasons; without it, we would not have seasons on Earth.

##Kepler’s Three Laws of Planetary Motion

1. The orbit of each planet around the Sun is an **ellipse** with the Sun at one **focus**.
1. As a planet moves around its orbit, it sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
1. Distant planets orbit the Sun at slower average speeds, obeying the relationship $p^2=a^3$ where $p$ is the orbital period in years and $a$ is the average orbital radius in AU

##The Sun

Chemical and gravitational energy sources could not explain how the Sun could sustain its luminosity for more than about 25 million years. The Sun shines because **gravitational equilibrium** keeps its core hot and dense enough to release energy through **nuclear fusion**.

From inside out, the layers of the Sun are:

* **Core**: site of nuclear fusion
* **Radiation zone**: photons/energy are ejected from the core
* **Convection zone**: rising hot gas circulates energy in the upper layers
* **Photosphere**: visible surface of the sun
* **Chromosphere**: middle solar atmosphere
* **Corona**: outer solar atmosphere

The core's extreme temperature and density are just right for nuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium through the proton–proton chain. Gravitational equilibrium acts as a **solar  thermostat** to regulate the core temperature because fusion rate is very sensitive to temperature.

Randomly bouncing photons carry energy through the radiation zone. Rising of hot plasma carries energy through the convection zone to photosphere. We know this because mathematical models agree with observations of solar vibrations and solar neutrinos.

##Main-Sequence Stars

A **Hertzsprung-Russell diagram** plots the luminosity and temperature of stars. **Main-sequence stars** are fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores like the Sun.

* **Luminosity**: from brightness and distance
* **Temperature**: from color and spectral type
* **Mass**: from period $p$ and average separation $a$ of binary star orbit

Stars with lower temperature and higher luminosity than main-sequence stars must have larger radii. These stars are called **giants** and **supergiants**.

Stars with higher temperature and lower luminosity than main-sequence stars must have smaller radii. These stars are called **white dwarfs**.

**High-Mass Star**:

* High luminosity
* Short-lived
* Larger radius
* Blue

**Low-Mass Star**:

* Low luminosity
* Long-lived
* Small radius
* Red

##Star Clusters

**Open clusters** are loosely packed and contain up to a few thousand stars. **Globular clusters** are densely packed and contain hundreds of thousands of stars.

A star cluster's age roughly equals the life expectancy of its most massive stars still on the main sequence.

##Star-Forming Clouds

Dark clouds of dusty gas called the **interstellar medium** form stars. Absorption lines in star spectra allow use to determine the composition of the clouds: 70% H, 28% He, 2% heavier elements.

Most of the mass in a star-forming cloud is molecule (H${}_2$, CO, etc.). These are referred to as **molecular clouds**, which have temperatures of 10-30 K and densities of 300 molecules/cm${}^3$. Knowledge of molecular clouds is mainly derived from CO emission lines.

##Interstellar Dust

Dust particles of **interstellar dust** form clouds that block incoming light from some stars. The particles are < 1 micrometer and consist of elements like C, O, Si, and Fe. The dust blocks blue (short wavelength) light better than red, so the edges of these dust clouds appear redder. Stars behind dust clouds can be seen more clearly through infrared wavelengths.

Some dust grains absorb visible light and heat up, emitting infrared light that is brightest where stars are actively forming. Gravity creates stars once it overcomes the force of thermal pressure in a cloud (**Jeans mass**). For typical molecular clouds, this is at least a few hundred solar masses.

\[M_{balance}=18M_{Sun}\sqrt{\frac{T^3}{n}}\]

##Star Life

Degeneracy pressure stops the contraction of objects $<0.08M_{Sun}$ before fusion starts. Stars greater than about $150M_{Sun}$ would be so luminous that radiation pressure would blow them apart. New observations may require raising this limit.

Star formation makes many more low-mass stars than high-mass stars.

The life stages of a low-mass star:

* Hydrogen fusion in core (main sequence)
* Hydrogen fusion in shell around contracting core (red giant)
* Helium fusion in core (horizontal branch)
* Double shell burning (red giant)

The fate of a low-mass star is ejection of hydrogen and helium in a planetary nebula, leaving behind an inert white dwarf.

The fate of a high-mass star is iron build up in core until degeneracy pressure can no longer resist gravity. The core then suddenly collapses, creating a supernova explosion.

#Galaxies

##Milky Way

The **Milky Way** is the galaxy the Sun resides in. It is 50,000 ly in radius and 1,000 ly in thickness. The Sun is 27,000 light-years from the center.

We view our galaxy edge-on. Some light is noticeably obscured by dusty gases, which absorb visible light. The gas is the **interstellar medium** that makes new star systems.

Galaxies have a number of common features, including:

* **disks**:
* **bulges**:
* **halos**:
* **globular clusters**:

The Milky Way is a **spiral galaxy**.

##Star Orbitals

Disk stars all orbit in the same direction with some transverse motion.

Bulge stars orbit with random orientations. These orbits bob up and down because _

Halo stars also orbit with random orientations and travel with noticeably greater distances above and below the disk.

The **Orbital Velocity Law** shows us that

\[M_r=\frac{r\cdot{}v^2}{G}\]

where $v$ is the orbital speed, $r$ is the radius of an object in circular orbit, and $M_r$ is the mass of the galaxy contained within the radius.

##Galactic Recycling

Stars with high mass have strong **stellar winds** that blow bubbles of hot gas. Stars with lower masses return gas to interstellar space through stellar winds and planetary nebulae.

**Galactic recycling** is a cyclic process caused by cooling gas:

* nuclear fusion forms new elements in stars
* dying stars expel new elements and gas, produce hot bubbles at $10^6 K$
* electrons can join protons, forming hydrogen and **atomic hydrogen clouds** at $10^4-10^5K$
* further cooling allows formation of **molecular clouds** at $30K$
* mass in molecular collects by gravity to form new stars and planets

Stages of galactic recycling can be observed by observing our galaxy through different wavelengths of light.

* **radio waves** (21 cm) are emitted by atomic hydrogen, showing where gas cools and settles into the disk. Carbon monoxide also emits radio waves, showing locations of molecular clouds
* **infrared** emission shows where young stars are heating dust grains, and reveals stars that are obscured by gas clouds
* **x-rays** are emitted by hot gases above and below the disk
* **gamma rays** show where cosmic rays from supernovae collide with atomic nuclei in gas clouds

Gas from dying stars mixes new elements into the interstellar medium, which slowly cools, making the molecular clouds where stars form. Those stars will eventually return much of their matter to interstellar space.

Active star-forming regions contain molecular clouds, hot stars, and ionization nebulae. Much of the star formation in our galaxy happens in the spiral arms.

##Galaxy Formation

Halo stars are all old, with a smaller proportion of heavy elements than disk stars, indicating that the halo formed first.

Halo stars formed early in the galaxy's history; disc stars formed later, after much of the galaxy's gas settled into a spinning disc.

Galaxies are classified by their morphology:

* **Spirals** (like the Milky Way): with spiral structure, disks, gas and dust, active star formation.
* **Barred Spiral**: spiral galaxies with a “bar” in the middle
* **Ellipticals**: large rounded balls of stars, with little gas and dust, no disks
* **Lenticulars**: intermediate in type between spirals and ellipticals. with disks but no spiral arms, some small amount of gas and dust

##Extrasolar Planets

It is challenging to learn about **extrasolar planets** because direct starlight is billions of times brighter than the starlight reflected from planets.

A star's **periodic motion** (detected through Doppler shifts or by measuring its motion across the sky) tells us about its planets: transiting planets periodically reduce a star's brightness. The Kepler mission has found thousands of candidates using this method.

Some extrasolar planets have highly elliptical orbits. Planets show huge diversity in size and density. Some properties of extrasolar planets are measurable:

* **Orbital** properties, such as period, distance, and shape.
* **Planetary** properties, such as mass and size.
* **Atmospheric** properties, such as temperature and composition.

Some massive planets, called **hot Jupiters**, orbit very close to their stars. Original nebular theory cannot account for the existence of hot Jupiters. **Planetary migration** or **gravitational encounters** may explain how Jupiter-like planets moved inward.

##Solar System Life

Life on Earth arose at least 3.85 billion years ago, shortly after the end of heavy bombardment. Life evolved from a common organism through natural selection, but we do not yet know the origin of the first organism. The necessities of life are nutrients, energy, and liquid water.

Evidence for liquid water in past suggests that life was once possible on Mars. **Jovian moons** are cold but some show evidence for subsurface water and other liquids.
