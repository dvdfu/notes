##Milky Way

The **Milky Way** is the galaxy the Sun resides in. It is 50,000 ly in radius and 1,000 ly in thickness. The Sun is 27,000 light-years from the center.

We view our galaxy edge-on. Some light is noticeably obscured by dusty gases, which absorb visible light. The gas is the **interstellar medium** that makes new star systems.

Galaxies have a number of common features, including:

* **disks**:
* **bulges**:
* **halos**:
* **globular clusters**:

The Milky Way is a **spiral galaxy**.

##Star Orbitals

Disk stars all orbit in the same direction with some transverse motion.

Bulge stars orbit with random orientations. These orbits bob up and down because _

Halo stars also orbit with random orientations and travel with noticeably greater distances above and below the disk.

The **Orbital Velocity Law** shows us that

\[M_r=\frac{r\cdot{}v^2}{G}\]

where $v$ is the orbital speed, $r$ is the radius of an object in circular orbit, and $M_r$ is the mass of the galaxy contained within the radius.

##Galactic Recycling

Stars with high mass have strong **stellar winds** that blow bubbles of hot gas. Stars with lower masses return gas to interstellar space through stellar winds and planetary nebulae.

Cooling hot gases allows electrons to join protons, forming hydrogen and **atomic hydrogen gas**. As the gas keeps cooling, atoms combine and the gas becomes **molecular gas**. Mass accumulates to form stars, and newly formed stars radiate and erode starforming clouds.
